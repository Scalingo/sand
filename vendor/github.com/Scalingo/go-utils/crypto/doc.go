// Package crypto includes common cryptography helpers.
//
// They typically make usie of the stdlib functions more ergonomic, and do not
// seek to invent new methods for encrypting or decrypting data.
//
// This package is inspired from  https://github.com/blend/go-sdk with the following changes:
// - Use of github.com/pkg/errors to wrap errors
package crypto // import "github.com/Scalingo/go-utils/crypto"
